# Documentation of the boat.JSON files ðŸ“š

This is the documentation to understand better the structure of all boat.json files.

```
"FileName" : string
```
Set the name of the 3D model file to load
```
"ScaleFactor" : number
```
The amount to scale the 3D model by Bridge Command uses *metres* as it's units, so if the model is in feet, then this should be around 0.3. <br /> <br /> 
**Note that all subsequent positions/distances are in the units/coordinate system of the 3D model file, except for the propulsion system**.

```json
"YCorrection" : number
```
The amount to move the model UP. Therefore, if the model's origin is at its keel, this should be a negative value.
```json
"AngleCorrection" : number
```
The number of degrees the model should be rotated about its vertical axis to correctly align it : the Bridge Command axis system is Y up and Z towards the model's stern (when viewed in a 3d model editor with a right handed coordinate system. Bridge Command uses a left handed system internally, so the Z axis is toward the sip's bow)
```json
"Depth" : number
```
The vessel's depth under the water line (in the 3D model's unit)

```json
"HasGPS" : bool
```
If this is set to True, the GÂ¨S position will be displayed
```json
"HasDepthSounder" : bool
```
If this is set to True, a depth sounder reading is displayed
```json
"MaxDepth" : number
```
If there is a depth sounder, the maximum depth that can be measured (m)
```json
"MakeTransparent" : bool
```
If this is set to True, any part of the model that is partially transparent will be made fully transparent. This is useful where models have bridge windows where the material used partially obscures the view.
```json
"Views" : array[array[number, number, number, boolean]]

//For example :
"View": [
    [ 0.0, 10.25, 3.62, false],
    [-1.8, 10.2, 3.2, false],
    [1.8, 10.2, 3.2, false],
    [-4.27, 6.91, -2.58, false],
    [4.27, 6.91, -2.58, false],
    [0.0, 350.0, 0.0, true]
]
```

| `[2]` | `number` | The viewpointâ€™s **Z coordinate** in the modelâ€™s unit system (valid only if `AngleCorrection = 0`). |
| `[3]` | `boolean` *(optional)* | Set to `true` if this is an **elevated view**, where the camera should automatically look straight down when activated. |

```json

```json
"AsternEfficiency" : number
```

```json
"BlockCoefficient" : number
```
(Optional) - The ratio of the volume a ships hull displaces of water and the volume of a cuboid of the same length, breadth and draught as the ship. It is used to calculate the ships mass. A typical values are 0.68 for a high speed container ship, 0.75 for an LNG tanker, 0.87 for a bulk carrier. If BlockCoefficient is defined then it overrides Mass and Inertia parameters as the ships mass and inertias are calculated from the dimensions of the ship model and draught. So if Block Coefficient is defined then there is no need to define Mass , Inertia. If however a non displacement craft such as a hovercraft is being modelled then the mass would need to be explicitly declared.

```

If the vessel has a normal propellor arrangement, with a single right turning propellor, or double outwards turning propellors, this should be positive. |
| `"walkAstern"` | `number` | (Optional) - **The maximum turning moment** (Nm) **applied by the 'prop walk' effect on the ship**, with the engine engaged astern. This should be positive for normal vessels, and should normally be larger than the ahead value. |

    "thrustLeverMaxChangePerSecond": 0.4,
    "sameDirectionAsSchottel": 1.0   
}
```
| Key | Type | Description |
|:----|:------:|:------------|
| `"azimuthDrive"` | `bool` | (Optional) - Set to *true* if the ship has azimuth drives, or *false* for conventional engine and rudder. |
| `"astern"` | `bool` | (Optional) - Set to *true* if the azimuth drives can be engaged astern (for example for an outboard motor). |
| `"azitoLengthRatio"` | `number` | **The distance along the axis of the vessel of the azimuth drives expressed as a proportion of the vessels length**. Valid values lie between (0 and 1). Typical values 0.2 for an azimuth stern drive tug, 0.1 for an azimuth driven coaster, 0.75 for a tractor tug. |
| `"engineIdleRPM"` | `number` | The engine RPM at which an engine idles with the thrust lever all the way back , engine declutched. It must be less than the azimuthDriveClutchDisengageRPM (a typical value for azimuthDriveEngineIdleRPM is 700). |
| `"clutchEngageRPM"` | `number` | The engine RPM which, when exceeded the clutch automaticall engages. It must be greater than the azimuthDriveClutchDisengageRPM (a typical value for azimuthDriveClutchEngageRPM is 1000). |
| `"clutchDisengageRPM"` | `number` | The engine RPM below which the clutch automatically disengages. It must be less than the azimuthDriveClutchEngageRPM but greater than the azimuthDriveEngineIdleRPM. (A typical value for azimuthDriveClutchDisengageRPM is 950). |
| `"engineMaxChangePerSecond"` | `number` | The proportion of the maximum engine rpm that the engine can change rpm in one second. e.g. 0.25 would mean it takes 4 seconds for an engine to go from a standstill to full power (typical value for a coaster 0.25, for an outboard engine on a speedboat 1, for a large bulk carrier 0.05). |
| `"maxDegPerSecond"` | `number` | The maximum number of degrees that the azipod drive can rotate in the lateral plane in one second. (typically 30). |
| `"thrustLeverMaxChangePerSecond"` | `number` | The maximum proportion of the full range that a thrust lever control can be changed in within one second, e.g 0.2 would mean it takes 5 seconds for the lever to go from full back to full forward. It only applies to keyboard control for playability. In reality the thrust lever can be moved as fast as your wrist can move it, however it will take time for the engine to respond to it. This is ignored if you have physical controls (typical value 0.4). |
| `"sameDirectionAsSchottel"` | `number` | On most vessels the azimuth drive turns in the same direction as the shcottel, so the thrust lever is in the same direction as the actual thrust from the propellor. So in the case of an azimuth stern drive configuration, the turning behaviour is similar to a tiller. Turn the schottel clockwise and the ship will turn to port. The opposite is true in a tractor configuration where the azimuth drives are ahead of amidships. However, some vessels equipped with aft mounted azimuth drives (e.g. Lass class ships, Shetland Trader , Neptune) have a different control response, which is when the schottel is turned clockwise then the azimuth drive turns anticlockwise. So when the schottel is turned clockwise the ship steers to starboard. So the thrust lever only points in the direction of the thrust when it is in the dead ahead or dead astern position. The objective is to make it easier to steer. Trust me it doesn't. (value is typically and normally 1). |
